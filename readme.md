**New Vatbook interface**

This repository contains files that wil change the looks 'n  feels of the Vatbook interface. This is a
project made in my spare time, and is not fully functional yet. 

Why use this instead of the default interface?

- This interface is fully responsive
- This interface does not contain deprecated HTML tags
- This interface has a modern look
